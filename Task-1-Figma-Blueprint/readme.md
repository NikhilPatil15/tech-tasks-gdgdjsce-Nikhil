# 🎨 GDG DJSCE – Tech Task 2 (Figma Design Replication using Next.js)

This project is a **pixel-perfect replication** of the given Figma design created as part of the **Google Developer Students Club (GDSC) DJSCE Tech Task**.  
The main objective of this task was to **recreate the provided Figma design exactly as shown**, focusing on maintaining perfect alignment, spacing, and styling — without making it responsive.

## 📘 Project Description

This project demonstrates the conversion of a Figma UI design into an actual web interface using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. Every element, color, font, and layout detail has been replicated to match the Figma design precisely.

The result is a static, non-responsive layout that matches the provided reference design **pixel by pixel**.

You can view the original design here:
